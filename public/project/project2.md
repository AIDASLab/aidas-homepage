# Neural Cloud Initiative

The Neural Cloud Initiative is more of a structural concept than a traditional system.  
We aim to interpret patterns through layered abstraction and soft logic.  
Right now, the main components are under initial review and data collection.

Though the methodology remains open-ended, early tests have shown a baseline for what's to come.  
Documentation is being drafted as the picture becomes clearer with ongoing collaboration.
