# Project Alpha

Project Alpha is designed to investigate certain aspects of applied machine learning.  
While the technical details are evolving, this project represents an early step toward more integrated approaches.  
Our current phase is mostly foundational, but we expect more to emerge over time.

In the coming months, our team will continue shaping the goals and refining the tools involved.  
The roadmap is flexible, and updates will follow as we gather feedback and develop further insights.
