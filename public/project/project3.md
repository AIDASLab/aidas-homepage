# Temporal Shift Framework

This project takes a broad look at how we treat sequence and time in various tasks.  
We’re building a lightweight design that may or may not evolve into something larger.  
There is no fixed architecture yet — only potential pathways and thought models.

The intention is not to finalize anything immediately, but to leave room for creative directions.  
Small updates are made regularly as we test, review, and refine ideas from different angles.
