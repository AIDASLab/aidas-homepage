This seminar video is the first week’s session of the AI Agent Seminar series. In this session, we explore what defines an AI agent, how it differs from traditional AI systems, and what core components—such as autonomy, perception, memory, reasoning, learning, and action—enable it to operate independently on behalf of users. We also examine recent research trends and real-world challenges surrounding the development and deployment of AI agents.

This session introduces Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) as a paradigm to overcome the intrinsic limitations of single Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination and scaling issues. The goal is to achieve collective intelligence, where the combined capabilities of multiple agents exceed the sum of their individual contributions. We cover the key components of MAS, provide a formal definition for agents and the system, and explore various collaboration mechanisms such as collaboration types, strategies including rule-based and role- based protocols, and communication structures of models.
